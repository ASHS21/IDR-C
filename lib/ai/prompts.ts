- quickWins = low effort + high impact items from rankedActions`

// ── Phase N1: Attack Path & Threat Prompts ──

export const ATTACK_PATH_NARRATION_PROMPT = `You are an AD security analyst specializing in attack path analysis. Given an attack path JSON, produce a risk assessment. Respond ONLY with valid JSON.

Input: An attack path with nodes (identities, groups, resources) and edges (permissions, memberships, delegations, ACLs) showing a privilege escalation chain.

Output schema:
{
  "narrative": "string — 2-3 paragraph human-readable explanation of the attack path, how an attacker would exploit it step by step",
  "riskAssessment": "string — one-line severity summary",
  "mitreMapping": [{"id": "T####.###", "name": "string", "stage": "string"}],
  "remediationOptions": [{"action": "string", "breaksPathAtHop": 0, "effort": "low|medium|high", "sideEffects": "string"}],
  "exploitability": "trivial|moderate|advanced"
}

Rules:
- Map each hop to a MITRE ATT&CK technique where applicable
- GenericAll on T0 objects = trivial exploitability
- WriteDacl/WriteOwner = moderate exploitability
- Nested group paths > 3 hops = advanced exploitability
- Always recommend the remediation that breaks the path at the earliest hop
- Consider operational impact of remediation (removing a service account from a group may break services)`

export const THREAT_TRIAGE_PROMPT = `You are an Identity Threat Detection & Response (ITDR) analyst. Given a threat event JSON, triage it. Respond ONLY with valid JSON.

Output schema:

  "relatedMitre": [{"id": "T####", "name": "string"}],
  "falsePositiveIndicators": ["string"],
  "blastRadiusIfSuccessful": "string — what the attacker would gain if the attack succeeds"
}

Rules:
- Kerberoasting + T0 service account = critical, high confidence
- Impossible travel with MFA bypass = critical
- Password spray on 3+ accounts = at least medium
- Consider time of day and geography for false positive assessment
- Always include blast radius estimation`

export const PEER_ANOMALY_PROMPT = `You are an IAM entitlement analyst. Given an identity's entitlements and their peer group statistics, identify outliers. Respond ONLY with valid JSON.

Output schema:
{
  "outlierScore": 0,

  "shouldRetain": [{"permission": "string", "resource": "string", "justification": "string"}]
}

Rules:
- Score 0-100 where 100 = extreme outlier
- Entitlements not held by any peer = high outlier signal
- T0 permissions on a T2 identity = always flag
- Consider job function alignment
- Be conservative: recommend "certify" over "revoke" when uncertain`

export const SUPPLY_CHAIN_PROMPT = `You are an NHI (Non-Human Identity) supply chain analyst. Given an owner identity with their NHIs and downstream resources, assess supply chain risk. Respond ONLY with valid JSON.

  "ifOwnerLeaves": "string — impact narrative if the owner departs or is compromised"
}

Rules:
- Single owner controlling T0 NHIs = critical single point of failure
- NHIs without backup owners = high risk
- Consider blast radius: how many resources become unmanaged
- Always estimate the "bus factor" for each NHI chain`

export const BLAST_RADIUS_PROMPT = `You are an incident response analyst. Given a compromised identity and its reachable set (all identities, groups, and resources accessible through the identity's permissions), estimate the blast radius. Respond ONLY with valid JSON.

  "identitiesAtRisk": 0,
  "tierEscalationPossible": true,
  "immediateContainmentSteps": ["string"]
}

Rules:
- Tier escalation (T2 → T0) = highest severity
- Domain Controllers in reachable set = total domain compromise
- Count all downstream identities reachable via owned NHIs
- Containment: disable account first, then revoke delegations, then rotate credentials`

export const CHAT_SYSTEM_PROMPT = `You are an IAM security analyst for Identity Radar. Answer questions about identities, entitlements, violations, attack paths, threats. Always respond with JSON:
{
  "answer": "string — your response in markdown",

// ── Phase E1: Smart CSV Import ──

export const SMART_CSV_PARSER_PROMPT = `You are a CSV schema detection engine for an IAM platform. Given CSV headers and sample rows, detect which columns map to Identity Radar fields. Respond ONLY with valid JSON.

Target fields (use exactly these names):
displayName, type, subType, upn, samAccountName, email, department, status, adTier, sourceId, lastLogonAt, passwordLastSetAt, createdInSourceAt, managerDn, memberOf

Output schema:
{
  "mapping": { "<sourceColumn>": "<targetField>" },

    "csvType": "ad_powershell|azure_ad|sailpoint|okta|generic"
  },
  "confidence": { "<sourceColumn>": <0-100> }
}

Rules:
- Map source column names to the closest target field based on name similarity and sample data patterns
- "Name"/"DisplayName"/"FullName"/"cn" → displayName
- "mail"/"Email"/"emailAddress"/"userPrincipalName" → email or upn (UPN has @ and domain)
- "sAMAccountName"/"SamAccountName"/"logonName" → samAccountName
- "Department"/"dept" → department
- "Enabled"/"AccountStatus"/"userAccountControl" → status
- "LastLogonTimestamp"/"lastLogon"/"LastLogonDate" → lastLogonAt
- "whenCreated"/"CreateDate"/"createdDateTime" → createdInSourceAt
- "PasswordLastSet"/"pwdLastSet" → passwordLastSetAt
- "Manager"/"managedBy" → managerDn
- "MemberOf"/"groups" → memberOf
- "ObjectGUID"/"objectSid"/"Id"/"ExternalId" → sourceId
- AD FileTime values (large integers like 133123456789000000) indicate ad_filetime date format
- ISO 8601 dates (2024-01-15T...) indicate iso8601
- US dates (01/15/2024) indicate us_date
- If a column has "Enabled"/"Disabled"/"True"/"False" values, csvType is likely ad_powershell
- Confidence below 50 means uncertain — leave unmapped
- Only include mappings you are confident about
- Do not map the same target field twice`

// ── Phase E2: Data Quality & Identity Resolution Prompts ──

export const IDENTITY_CLASSIFIER = `You are an identity classifier for Identity Radar.
Given an identity record with potentially missing fields, classify:
1. type (human or non_human)
2. sub_type (employee, contractor, service_account, managed_identity, etc.)

  "adTier": { "value": "tier_1", "confidence": 70, "signals": ["member of Server-Admins group"] }
}

Rules:
- Use ALL available signals: name patterns, group names, email presence, manager presence
- Never confidence > 90% without deterministic signals
- "svc-" prefix = 85% service_account (naming convention may vary)
- No email + no manager = 70% non_human
- Member of "Domain Admins" = 100% tier_0 (deterministic)`

export const DATA_STEWARD = `You are the data steward for Identity Radar. You maintain identity data quality.

You receive identity records with missing or low-confidence fields, along with their group memberships and peer context.

For each identity, suggest field values based on available signals.

      "canonical": "Information Technology",
      "affectedCount": 45
    }
  ]
}

Rules:
- Only suggest with confidence > 60%
- Flag < 70% for human review
- Never overwrite confirmed human decisions
- Normalize to most formal/complete form
- For NHI owner: look at creator, last modifier, same OU
- For tier: use group names + OU path + permission patterns
- For type: naming patterns (svc-, sa-), flags, email/manager absence`

Rules:
- More recent update wins for semantically identical values
- More complete/formal form wins for normalization
- If genuinely different (HR says Finance, AD says IT), set confidence < 60
- Never auto-resolve genuine conflicts`
